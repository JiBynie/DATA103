   **Abstract**

  This paper explores the intricate dynamics of exchange rates within the ASEAN-5 regionâ€”comprising the Philippines, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. Despite the historical benefits of globalization, the study reveals external factors necessitating increased regional integration, specifically in coordinating monetary policies influenced by exchange rates. Delving into historical currency variations and volatility, we highlight active government involvement in foreign exchange markets to prevent excessive fluctuations. This analysis aims to illuminate the nuanced relationships among the ASEAN-5 currencies, emphasizing the importance of exchange rate forecasting for well-informed decision-making in international trade, investment, and finance.
